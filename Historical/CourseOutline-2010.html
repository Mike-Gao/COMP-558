<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Overview</span></big><br>
<p>Computer vision involves the development of algorithms and software
that have the potential to mimic a biological organism's ability to
``see''. Though the sense of vision is immediate for most people, the
complexity of the task that the human visual system accomplishes is in
fact enormous.  The field of computer vision has grown steadily over
the past few decades, and has advanced to the point where a set of
core algorithms and techniques now exist for solving specific vision
problems in constrained settings.  Several international research
laboratories now exist and applications of computer vision techniques
in industry, robotics, and bio-medicine abound. This course seeks to
present the fundamentals of computer vision at an advanced
undergraduate/beginning graduate level.  &nbsp; Students will become
familiar with the basic theoretical and practical tools of computer
vision, which would be needed to carry out research or to
find employment in this field.
</p>
<big style="font-weight: bold;">Course Contents<br>
<br>
</big>The course in Fall 2010 will consist
of three parts.  Lectures will cover most of the specific
topics below.<br>
<br>
Part 1:&nbsp;&nbsp; Image Formation<br>
<ul>
  <li>image projection with a
pinhole camera</li>
  <li>motion field seen by a
moving observer&nbsp; (translation and rotation)</li>
  <li>camera model&nbsp;
(homogeneous coordinates, extrinsic and intrinsic parameters) </li>
  <li>thin lens model&nbsp;
(aperture, f-stop, blur, depth of field)</li>
  <li>lighting and
reflectance&nbsp; (light and shade, specularities, radiance, BRDF)</li>
  <li>image
capture&nbsp; (color, RGB, image irradiance, exposure, dynamic
range, noise, sampling)</li>
</ul>
Part 2:&nbsp; Image Analysis&nbsp;<br>
<ul>
  <li>basic linear
systems (convolution, filtering, noise, derivatives, smoothing)</li>
  <li>edge detection
(Canny),&nbsp; corner detection (2nd moment matrix, Harris vs.
Laplacian) </li>
  <li>scale space, SIFT </li>
  <li>motion estimation (aperture problem, Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi, Horn &
  Schunk) </li>
  <li>line fitting (least squares, Hough transform,&nbsp; RANSAC)</li>
<li> finding a vanishing point </li>
</ul>
Part 3:&nbsp;&nbsp; 3D Vision<br>
<ul>
  <li>shape from shading (sunny vs. cloudy days) </li>
  <li>shape from texture, defocus&nbsp;</li>
<li> least squares, SVD </li>
  <li>geometric camera calibration</li>
  <li>homographies</li>
  <li>structure from motion (egomotion, factorization) </li>
  <li>epipolar geometry, estimating the fundamental matrix</li>
  <li> dense stereo correspondence (graph cuts)
</ul>

<big style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
Official Course Description from McGill Calendar<br>
<br>
</big>
Biological vision, edge
detection, projective geometry and camera
modeling, shape from shading and texture, stereo vision, optical flow,
motion analysis, object representation, object recognition, graph
theoretic methods, high level vision, applications.<br>
<br>
 <i> Note: this description applies to previous version of the
  course taught by Prof. Kaleem Siddiqi.  While there is a large
  overlap between these topics and those covered this year, there are
  significant differences as well.   This year, in particular, we will
  not be covering object recognition, differential geometry of
  surfaces.   These topics will be covered in Prof. Siddiqi's 7xx course 
  offered in the Winter 2011.

<br><br>
<big style="font-weight: bold;">Prerequisites</big><br>
<br>
Students should have a solid&nbsp;background in basic Calculus,
Linear Algebra, Algorithms and Data structures, and 
Programming. &nbsp; &nbsp;The official prerequisites for the
course are &nbsp;<a

222,</a><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span>
<a
 href="http://www.mcgill.ca/global/php/coursepopup.php?Course=MATH%20223&amp;Year=2009-2010%27"

223</a> <b> (or equivalent)</b>.

It is strongly recommended that <i> students only take this
course if they received A grades in MATH 222 and 223 (or equivalent).</i>
<br>
 <br>Students who do
not have these prerequisites may still be allowed to take the course,
 but only  with the
permission of the instructor. &nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;<br>
<big style="font-weight: bold;">Lecture
Notes, Readings, Textbooks</big><br>
<br>
The material covered in the lectures will be available in the form of
Lecture Notes written by the
instructor and posted as PDFs
on the course web page, or as handouts.&nbsp; Readings also will be made available
typically in electronic form.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<br>
There is no required textbook for the course.  There are, however,
several good texts out there and students are encouraged to consult
with them.   See for example Richard Szeliski's online book <a href="http://szeliski.org/Book">
		      Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications</a>

<br><br> &nbsp;There are also textbooks available on reserve in the <a
 href="http://www.mcgill.ca/schulich/">Schulich
Science and Engineering library.</a>
