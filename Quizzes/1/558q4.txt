the filter basically does thisï¼š
let A = 
.............
... a b c ...
... d e f ...
... g h i ...
.............

the convolution then is (g+h+i)-(a+b+c)
As for 1st derivative, we "basically" need:
(h-b)/2
In this case, we can do (ave(h)-ave(b))/2
and ave(h) = (g+h+i)/3, ave(b) = (a+b+c)/3
so 1st derivative is:
((g+h+i)-(a+b+c))/(3*2) = ((g+h+i)-(a+b+c))/6
so the coefficient is 1/6
